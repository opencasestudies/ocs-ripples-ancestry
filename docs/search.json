    "text": "Why is variation important?\nWhy should we care about human genomic variation, especially if there’s so much identity? Some variation is “functional” and leads to changes not just in the genome, but also in the proteins that are translated from the genetic material; however, not all variation is “functional”. These functional changes may impact how much of a protein is made, the protein structure and therefore its eventual role in the cell, or where and when the protein is expressed due to changes in regulatory elements. Certain diseases may be caused or worsened by genetic variation. Cancer is a common example of this where genes that control cell growth, division, or scheduled cell death are mutated and their proteins do not function properly to control this cell cycle, leading to tumors. For other diseases, (such as sickle-cell anemia and the Hemoglobin protein), a protein may not be expressed at the correct levels or the protein may be folded incorrectly because of its mutated structure, leading to inefficiencies in or the inability of the protein to perform its cellular essential function(s). Biological redundancy acts as a safety net such that the cell has backup systems that can mitigate issues by compensating or taking the place of nonfunctional components. But even with redundancy systems, mutations can lead to small changes with major consequences\n\n\n\nDifferent types of mutations\n\nSingle-nucleotide changes\nDifferent types of single-nucleotide mutations are defined based on the effect of the mutation.\n\nSilent mutations have an underlying nucleotide change, but the amino acid building blocks of the protein remain unchanged. Not only does the protein remain unchanged, but for a true “silent” mutation, there is no effect on the cell.\nSynonymous mutations: Synonymous mutations have an underlying nucleotide change, and the amino acid building blocks of the protein remain unchanged. They differ from silent mutations, however, because these have an impact on the cell. This impact could be due to how often a protein is produced because certain codons are less available or may take longer to process in translation; so while these mutations code for the same amino acid, they have an effect in the cell and aren’t considered “silent”.\nMissense mutations result in an amino acid substitution which can impact protein structure and function.\n\nSome missense mutations are “conservative” where the amino acid substitution is switching one amino acid for another similar one with similar biochemical properties (e.g., size, charge, etc.).\nA “non-conservative” missense mutation switches an amino acid to one with dissimilar biochemical properties – this is likely to have a greater impact on protein structure and function than a conservative missense mutation.\n\nNonsense mutations introduce an early stop codon halting translation and producing a truncated, likely nonfunctional protein.\n\nSingle-nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels)\nA single nucleotide insertion or deletion (or one that is a length not a multiple of three – 3 is the length of a codon) may introduce a frameshift mutation. Frameshift mutations often impact structure and function to a higher degree than missense mutations because these cause downstream impacts, shifting the reading frame during translation for all subsequent codons.\n\nGenetic variation isn’t of interest solely because of mutation and its relation to disease. Genetic variation is also considered necessary for survival. The Red Queen Hypothesis stipulates that species must constantly evolve and adapt to survive, especially when competing with other species (e.g., predators vs prey, virus-host interactions, etc.). Given this, heritable variation (e.g., germline mutations or recombination during meiosis) is beneficial to the species by supporting evolution, allowing for the selection of advantageous traits necessary for adaptation and survival either due to competition or novel locations with their share of environmental challenges and unique resources. In other words, evolution depends upon the random accidents and mistakes that are mutations being maintained within a population because of the non-random survival due to the changes being advantageous."

    "text": "Finding Relatedness\nEveryone within the human species inherited genomic material from two individuals and each of those individuals inherited genomic material from two other individuals, continuing backwards through the family history. And by expanding this to consider the evolution of species, this history traces back to shared or common ancestors of different species. If we consider two humans, we won’t have to go very far back to find a common ancestor, but comparing a human with an organism from another species, we will have to go back a longer amount of time to find a common ancestor. Since genomic material is what is passed down from ancestors, genomic material is what is compared when considering ancestry and how individuals and species are related. Individuals that are more closely related will share more genomic material in common than those that are more distantly related. When comparing genomic material between individuals, sequence similarity or identity is a quantitative measure describing how much overlap or matching there is between the genomic material. Homology is a qualitative description inferred from the amount of similarity and suggests that the sequences or genomic material share a common ancestor. Models used to compare sequences take into account the different kinds of mutations and how commonly they occur."
